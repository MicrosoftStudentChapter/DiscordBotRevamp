# Get a new Discord token:

##  Here are the steps to get a new Discord token:

- Open the Discord website (discord.com) and log in to your account.

- Click on the "User Settings" icon in the lower-left corner of the screen. It looks like a gear icon.

- From the menu that appears, select "Developer Settings."

- In the Developer Settings menu, click on the "New Application" button.

- Enter a name for your application and click "Create."

- In the new application menu, click on the "Bot" tab, then click the "Add Bot" button.

- A new window will appear asking you to confirm the creation of a new bot. Click "Yes, do it!"

- Under the "Bot" section, you will see a button that says "Click to Reveal Token". Click it to reveal your bot token.

- Copy the token and save it somewhere secure. Do not share this token with anyone else, as it can be used to access your Discord account.

### That's it! You now have your own Discord token. Remember to keep it safe and secure, and follow Discord's terms of service and guidelines while using the platform.
